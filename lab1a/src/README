Description of Files:
lab1a.c
	Source code for the program. It is a character-at-a-time full duplex 
	terminal I/O. Without --shell argument, the terminal simply writes each 
	character back to the screen as it is typed and processed. With --shell
	argument, a separate shell process is forked, and our inputs from the 
	terminal are piped to the shell program. The shell processes the commands 
	given, and outputs the result through a pipe back to the terminal, which 
	then processes a character at a time to display to the terminal.

Makefile
	Contains shell commands to be executed with specific targets: default,
	clean, and dist to build the program and the tarball.

README
	This file, which details information of the files of the project,
	and the resources used for research.

Resources:
I used a lot of the manual pages and documents found on
www.gnu.org and man7.org

Additional to those man pages, I also used the following:
