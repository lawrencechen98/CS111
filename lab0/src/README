Description of Files:
lab0.c
	The C source code module that compiles to the project 0 program.
	It copies standard input to standard output from file descriptor 0 to
	file descriptor 1. It can also accept optional command line arguments
	such as --input and --output filenames to redirect the standard input
	and standard output respectively. With the --segfault flag, the program
	forces a segmentation fault, which can be caught if a --catch flag is
	specified.

Makefile
	Contains shell commands to be executed with specific targets: default,
	check, clean, and dist to build the program and the tarball.

README
	This file, which details information of the files of the project, the
	smoke tests I used, and the resources I used for research.

backtrace.png
	A screenshot showing a segfault and associated stack-trace of my
	project's executable when ran with --segfault flag. It shows that the
	program received a SIGSEGV signal at line 27.

breakpoint.png
	A screenshot showing a breakpoint and variable inspection of my
	project's executable right before the code that would raise a
	segmentation fault. A breakpoint was added at line 27, and the nullptr
	can be seen pointing to memory address 0x0.

Description of Smoke Tests:
testReadWrite
	Tests that the program works as intended, reading from a specified
	--input file and writing to an --output file correctly, while exiting
	with return code of 0.

testInvalidOptions
	Tests that program exits with return code 1 if given unrecognized
	command line arguments.

testInvalidInput
	Test that program exits with return code 2 if given an nonexisting
	filename for --input option.

testInvalidOutput
	Test that program exits with return code 3 if given an --output file
	that is read-only and cannot be written to.

testSegfaultCatch
	Test that program exits with return code 4 if the segmentation fault is
	caught with the --segfault and --catch flag.
