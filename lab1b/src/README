Description of Files:
lab1b-server.c
	Source code for the server side program. A separate shell process is forked, 
	and our inputs from the client that is received through a TCP network socket 
	are piped to the shell program. The shell processes the commands given, 
	and outputs the result through a pipe back to the server program, which 
	then sends back through the socket to the client. The port number for the 
	socket is specified with --port option, and the --compress flag compresses
	the data sent through the socket. 

lab1b-client.c
	Source code for the client side program. It is a non-canonical character
	at a time terminal, that takes input and sends it through a socket to the
	server program. The port number should match that of the server and is 
	specified with the --port flag. --compress flag compresses the data
	sent to the server, and decompresses responses. The output is received
	from the server program and displayed onto the terminal. 

Makefile
	Contains shell commands to be executed with specific targets: default,
	clean, and dist to build the program and the tarball. Also includes 
	targets server and client to build only that respective executable.

README
	This file, which details information of the files of the project,
	and the resources used for research.
