INCLUDED FILES
==============

lab4b.c 
	Source code for program. Using event loop, the program reads temperature from the sensor at a set period of time, generating reports, and processing command input from STDIN.

Makefile
	Contains targets to build executable, run checks with smoke tests, build distribution tarball, and clean.

README
	This file. Contains information on included files and resources used.




RESOURCES USED
==============

I used a lot of the manual pages and documents found on
www.gnu.org and man7.org, and other similar documentation
for information on poll, specific function calls such as gettimeofday() and other functions.

I also used the provided manuals on MRAA libraries to do I/O and the documentation for the temperature sensor.
